# Custom Names [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/customnames)
This mod lets you change what other players names look like. You can have different customization for every player. I recommend using [ModMenu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) to access the config, but there is a JSON5 file in ```config/customnames.json5``` if you want to do it manually.

## Customization Options
Change a players name, Change a players name color, Add a prefix to a players name, and Add a suffix to a players name.
